# AGGM-JS-LM

**AGGM-JS-LM** is a simple, client-side JavaScript language model. It runs entirely in the browserâ€”no server or API needed.

## Usage

```javascript
console.log(askAI("hi"));
console.log(askAI("What's up?"));
console.log(askAI("Tell me about the weather"));
```

Call `askAI(prompt)` with a string to get a response based on the internal corpus.

## Customization

You can expand the model by adding prompt-response pairs to the `CORPUS` and the `responses` array array:

## Summary

- 100% client-side
- Single JS file
- Easy to modify and extend
